                        <p>As part of the Intelligent Back-Office project, a university research endeavor aimed at
                            challenging startups in automating document processing, particularly scanned invoices, I led
                            the implementation of our custom OCR system. Operating within resource-constrained language
                            settings, specifically Czech, my role involved handling annotated documents. This
                            encompassed preprocessing data and training models. Additionally, I orchestrated
                            post-processing procedures to rectify errors, such as the second OCR run, which, after NER
                            classification, identified fields as numbers. The outcome of this effort yielded a robust
                            pipeline capable of processing approximately 70% of invoices originating from low-quality
                            scans and photos.

                            implementing this idea, I achieved a singificant improvement in OCR accuracy, likely
                            attributed to challenging assumptions that were previously inherent in the OCR systems. This

                        <p>I can process various data formats using Python
                            libraries, such as numpy or Pandas, from images to spatial data. Preprocessing usually
                            includes exploratory analysis,
                            feature engineering, data curation, and standardization. I can create efficient pipelines to
                            avoid unnecessary data inflations or transfers. I can work with big data, collecting
                            data from Hadoop clusters or SQL databases.</p>

                <p>I have recently moved to Germany ready to settle down and find a stable long-term position where I
                    could found my value to society.</p>
                <p>Apart from being a data scientist, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. During the
                    warmer months here in Heidelberg, I enjoy bouldering, climbing, and swimming.</p>
                <p>When forced indoors, I usually play guitar or bass in a spontaneous jam sessions or play boardgames.
                    I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the deep
                    learning world.</p>
